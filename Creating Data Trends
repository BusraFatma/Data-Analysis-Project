1. Prepare and Clean the Data

Identify and handle missing or erroneous data.
Normalize the data if necessary (for example, when the data is on different scales).
Ensure that time series data is properly sorted with consistent intervals.

isualize the Data (Initial Exploration)

Plot the data to observe trends, seasonal patterns, or irregularities.
Line charts are ideal for visualizing time-series trends.

3. Identify the Trend Components
In trend analysis, we focus on 3 main components:

Trend: The overall increase or decrease pattern over time.
Seasonality: Regular and repeating patterns (e.g., seasonal sales spikes).
Irregularity (Noise): Random, unpredictable changes in the data.

4. Apply Moving Average for Smoothing
Moving averages help smooth out short-term fluctuations, making the trend more visible.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data
data = pd.DataFrame({'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=30),
                     'Sales': [50, 52, 53, 51, 56, 58, 57, 60, 65, 64,
                               62, 63, 67, 68, 65, 70, 75, 77, 76, 80,
                               85, 82, 87, 85, 90, 88, 95, 96, 97, 100]})

# Calculate 7-day moving average
data['Moving Average'] = data['Sales'].rolling(window=7).mean()

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(data['Date'], data['Sales'], label='Daily Sales')
plt.plot(data['Date'], data['Moving Average'], label='7-Day Moving Average', linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.title('Sales Trend Analysis')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

 5. Use Time-Series Models 
To better understand trends and seasonality, you can apply time-series models such as:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Commonly used for forecasting time-series data.
Holt-Winters Model: Suitable for data with both trend and seasonal patterns.

6. Forecasting and Model Validation
Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate model accuracy.
Use error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) to assess model performance.

7. Reporting and Presentation
Visualize the results and create a report with key findings.
Highlight whether a significant trend or seasonality exists and provide actionable insights for the future.
