D3.js and SVG.js are two popular JavaScript libraries used for visualisation in web applications.
Both allow you to create visuals using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). 

D3.js (Data-Driven Documents)
Allows you to make interactive visualisations with data. D3 manipulates documents based on data, interacting directly with the DOM. It is versatile and offers a large set of APIs for creating complex visualisations.
