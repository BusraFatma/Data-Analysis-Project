**FOR VISUAL ANALYSIS;**

*Tools to be used:*

- PLC: To control the production line and sensors (including cameras).
- Optical Cameras: To take images of products or the production process.
- Python and OpenCV: To process and analyse images.
  

*System Components and Functions:*

**1- Optical Cameras:** Continuously takes images from the production line.

**2-Image Processing Software (Python/OpenCV):** Processes incoming images, checks that products are the correct size and shape, detects colour errors or other visual defects.

**3-PLC:** Using the information from the cameras and image processing software, it controls the machines on the production line, rejects faulty products and stops or changes the settings of the production line when necessary.
